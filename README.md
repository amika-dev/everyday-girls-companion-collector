# Everyday Girls: Companion Collector

**Everyday Girls: Companion Collector** is a lighthearted web game where players collect companions through a small daily routine, build bonds over time, and manage a growing personal roster at their own pace.

The game is designed around intentional, low-pressure progression. Each day offers limited actions, encouraging relaxed play over time rather than long sessions, optimization, or competition.

Players can:
- Discover and adopt new companions through a daily system
- Assign a single active partner and interact once per day to build bonds
- Manage and sort their collection of companions
- Progress slowly and casually without time pressure or competitive elements

The focus of the experience is simplicity, routine, and gradual growth rather than depth or complexity.
